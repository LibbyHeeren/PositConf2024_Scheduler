Breaking Barriers: Adopting R in Biotech with Posit - Nicole JonesIn recent years, there has been a notable surge in R adoption in pharmaceutical and biotech sectors, demanding regulated environments for R-based workflows. Posit offers a comprehensive ecosystem of tools designed to meet these needs. While these tools offer advantages, there is an additional burden placed on companies to maintain the environment. One notable challenge is integrating the Posit tools with a regulated Statistical Computing Environment(SCE) while ensuring standardized environments across the development and regulated systems. In this talk, we will share the benefits, challenges and lessons learned leveraging the Posit ecosystem in a mid-sized biotech company. 
Mastering the Art of Adopting R and Python: Innovative Strategies for Effective Change Management - Mark BynensMastering the Art of Adopting R and Python: Innovative Strategies for Effective Change Management' is more than just a presentation; it's a roadmap to navigate the complexities to integrate R and Python into our daily operations in a world that never slows down. Through an in-depth look at some real-world examples from Janssen R&D moving towards R and Python we will show you how it's done. This isn't just theory; it's practical, actionable advice. 
As we embark on a journey to weave R and Python into the fabric of our organization, let's keep these insights and strategies at the forefront. Together, we can redefine what it means to be adaptable and resilient in an ever-changing world. 
A New Era for Shiny-based Clinical Submissions using WebAssembly - Eric NantzIn life sciences, Shiny has enabled tremendous innovations to produce web interfaces as front-ends to sophisticated analyses, interactive visualizations, and clinical reporting. While industry sponsors have widely adopted Shiny, a relatively unexplored frontier has been the inclusion of a Shiny application inside a submission package to the FDA. The R Consortium R-Submissions Working Group has continued the momentum of previous submission pilots, such as the successful Shiny app submission to FDA in 2023. In this talk, I will share the journey of how we used containers and WebAssembly for a new and innovative approach to sharing a Shiny application directly with the FDA, paving the way for new innovation in the clinical submission process. 
Open-Source Initiatives in Pharma - What's Out There and Why You Should Join - Nicholas MaselThe pharmaceutical industry has come a long way when it comes to using open-source and collaborating on initiatives to solve complex industry issues. The number of initiatives and working groups that are now available have grown so much over the last 5 to 10 years that understanding what to join, or even just what to keep track of, can feel like selecting an R package, you’ve got a lot of options! This is a good problem to have, but it can also feel like a barrier to entry for companies or individuals in the industry who are looking to learn and/or contribute. In this talk, I will present guidance to the pharmaceutical industry to help them navigate the open-source collaboration landscape to help companies and individuals get involved.",300 | Columbia C

Abstracts:
Making sense of marginal effects - Demetri PananosThe marginaleffects package for R and python offers a single point of entry to easily interpret over 100 types of models using a simple and consistent interface. Marginaleffects has become an indispensable tool for moving away from tables of regression coefficients and towards easily interpretable and estimates. In addition to making regression models more interpretable, marginaleffects offers flexible plotting tools, efficient implementations, validated results against Stata, and a thoroughly documented website abundant with examples and vignettes. 
This talk is for data scientists and data analysts who analyze data with regression models. We’ll cover how to estimate and visualize a variety of effect summaries with marginaleffects. 
Understanding, Generating, and Evaluating Prediction Intervals - Bryan ShallowayFor many problems concerning prediction, providing intervals is more useful than just offering point estimates. This talk will provide an overview of: 
 
How to think about uncertainty in your predictions (e.g. noise in the data vs uncertainty in estimation) 
Approaches to producing prediction intervals (e.g. parametric vs conformal) 
Measures and considerations when evaluating and training models for prediction intervals 
 
While I will touch on some similar topics as Max Kuhn’s posit::conf(2023) talk on conformal inference, my talk will cover different points and have a broader focus. I hope attendees gain an understanding of some of the key tools and concepts related to prediction intervals and that they leave inspired to learn more. 
Keras 3: Deep Learning made easy - Tomasz KalinowskiKeras 3 is a ground-up rewrite of Keras 2, keeping everything that was already great the same, while refining and simplifying parts of the API based on lessons accumulated over the past few years. Come to this talk to learn about all the features (new and old) in Keras that make it easy to build, train, evaluate and deploy deep learning models. 
Quality Control to avoid GIGO in Deep Learning Models - Vasant MarurDeep Learning models help answer scientific questions, but they are only as accurate as the data we feed them. To ensure accurate models, we can implement quality control (QC) methods to ensure only high quality data is used in training these models. Scientists generate thousands of images as part of Image-Based High Content Screening assays. To help them quickly assess the quality of these images before considerable time is spent analyzing them, we developed an interactive tool using Shiny that displays which images were flagged as part of QC. In this talk, I’ll explain how we created this QC tool and share ideas on how you could leverage your existing code and turn it into a stand alone web app your stakeholders can use.",Elwha

Beyond the Classroom: Unspoken Realities of a Data Science Career - Brandon Sucher 
Embarking on a data science career extends well beyond academic knowledge. In many ways, the learning has just begun. Soft skills have become increasingly valuable, with effective collaboration being essential for success. Additionally, there may be moments when advocating for your own work is crucial, turning data scientists into persuasive salespeople for their own insights and contributions. In this talk, I'll touch on some of the aspects of a data science job that aren't talked about as frequently, including onboarding successfully, becoming a subject matter expert, and understanding the end-to-end data workflow. 
GitHub: How To Tell Your Professional Story - Abigail Haddad 
GitHub is more than just a version control tool, it's a way of explaining your professional identity to prospective employers and collaborators – and you can build your profile now, before you're looking for new opportunities. This talk is about how to think of GitHub as an opportunity, not a chore, and how to represent yourself well without making developing your GitHub profile into a part-time job. I'll talk about why GitHub adds value beyond a personal website, what kinds of projects are helpful to share, and some good development practices to get in the habit of, regardless of your project specifics. 
Getting Data Done with a Pragmatic Data Team - Alan Schussman 
Data work comes in lots of forms, and large organizations with reliable pipelines of similar problems can be very specialized in how they tackle this work. My contention is that many organizations doing data work don't get to be so picky: Instead of specialized roles in focused parts of a data process, many of us work from end to end, and projects often differ in the tools and domain knowledge they require. Identifying and making use of good, reusable practices in this environment is hard, and there's not a consistent supply of some of the work that's most appealing to ambitious data people. This talk explores some successes and failures in building flexible, effective, empowered teams in this environment. 
Oops I'm A Manager - Finding your Minimal Viable Process - Andrew Holz 
In today's fast-paced, data-driven landscape, transitioning to a leadership role can be daunting. This talk is designed for emerging data team leaders, offering insights into striking the right balance between a clear effective process and the flexibility required for team members to do their best work. It emphasizes the importance of iterative process design, establishing effective feedback loops, and empowering team members with autonomy. These key strategies put into action as team habits provide a blueprint for an adaptable workflow relevant to a range of different organizations. The talk aims to create a framework where both efficiency and creativity can thrive together.",300 | Columbia D

Adequate Tables? No, We Want Great Tables - Richard IannoneTables are great, and we’ve been doing a lot on both the R and Python sides to make it possible to generate aesthetically pleasing tables. The gt package for R has been under continuous development for six years and there is still so many things we can do to make it better. Great Tables, our new Python package, brings beautiful tables to Python users and provides an API that’s in tune with that ecosystem. 
While we have made great strides and unlocked new table-making possibilities for our users, our ambitions are huge! So, we’d like to show you the state of things on this front and also where we intend to go with our collective table efforts. 
Context is King - Shannon PileggiThe quality of data science insights is predicated on the practitioner’s understanding of the data. Data documentation is the key to unlocking this understanding; with minimal effort, this documentation can be natively embedded in R data frames via variable labels. Variable labels seamlessly provide valuable data context that reduces human error, fosters collaboration, and ultimately elevates the overall data analysis experience. As an avid, daily user of variable labels, I am excited to help you discover new workflows to create and leverage variable labels in R! 
gtsummary: Streamlining Summary Tables for Research and Regulatory Submissions - Daniel SjobergThe gtsummary R package empowers researchers and analysts to create publication-ready summary tables efficiently. Developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, it quickly gained traction and has become the most downloaded package for summary tables on CRAN. 2024 marked a significant expansion for gtsummary. A comprehensive codebase update enhanced performance and introduced new features. Further, the adoption of CDISC’s Analysis Results Data standard enables compliance with emerging FDA submissions standards, maintaining relevance for various research and regulatory needs. gtsummary offers a robust solution for generating clear, informative tables, saving time and ensuring quality for researchers and analysts across diverse fields. 
Stitch by Stitch: The Art of Engaging New Users - Becca KrouseIn the world of crochet, the Woobles kit simplifies yarn, hooks, and stitches for beginners, alleviating decision fatigue and fostering early success. This model unexpectedly extends to the domain of R. Newcomers, especially in industries less familiar to open-source, may find mastering new tools daunting. We grappled with this while developing {tfrmt}, a table-making package for pharma. This talk will draw parallels with crochet to explore strategies for engaging and retaining new users. Attendees will grasp the role of a starter kit for easing the learning curve and the value of nurturing experts with transferable skills.

20+ Years of Reading Data into R - Colin GillespieFor the last 20+ years, I've been reading data into R. It all started with the humble scan() function. Then, I used fancy new-fangled file formats, such as parquet and arrow, before progressing onto trendy databases, such as duckdb, for analytics. Besides the fun you can have by messing around with new technologies, when should you consider the above formats? In this talk, I'll cover a variety of methods for importing data and highlight the good, the bad, and the annoying. 
Contributing to the R Project - Heather TurnerPosit provides an amazing set of products to support data science, and we will learn about many great packages and approaches from both Posit and the wider community at posit::conf(2024). But underlying it all are a number of open source tools, notably R and Python. How can we contribute to sustaining these open source projects, so that we can continue to use and build on them? 
In this talk I will address this question in the context of the R project. I will give an overview of the ways we can contribute as individuals or companies/organizations, both financially and in kind. Together we can build a more sustainable future for R! 
What I Learned Resurrecting an R package - Dave SlagerWe hear a lot about creating R packages, but R packages don't last forever on their own. I describe my experience resurrecting rvertnet, an abandoned ropensci project that had become stale on CRAN. I talk about how I found out the package needed a new maintainer, how I took ownership of the package, and how I decided what needed fixing. I discuss several examples of package repairs I implemented, including fixing outdated CI, removing unnecessary files and dependencies, writing workarounds for deprecated functions, and fixing building of a vignette. Finally, I'll describe my positive experiences communicating with the old maintainer and submitting a package to CRAN for the first time. 
Building Sustainable Open Source Ecosystems: Lessons From the #rstats Community and an NSF Grant - Kelly BodwinThe blessing and the curse of open-source software is that it lacks the infrastructure of a corporation. It can often be difficult to ensure that projects have stability and longevity. In this talk, I will discuss ongoing work on an NSF ""Pathways in Open-Source Ecosystems"" grant focused on the {data.table} package. Like many R packages, {data.table} has incredible functionality and thousands of users - but no cohesive community or governance structure to support it long-term. We are working to build this ecosystem. I will provide my advice and insight for key aspects of a sustainable open-source project: Engaging casual users, supporting developers, generating content, emphasizing education, and creating a home base for the community.",300 | Columbia D

Abstracts:
tidymodels for time-to-event data - Hannah FrickSurvival analysis is a part of statistical modeling (and machine learning) specifically for time-to-event data. This is common in medical research but has broad applications across industries, e.g. for analyzing customer churn. The tidymodels framework is a collection of R packages for safe, performant, and expressive predictive modeling. We added models for survival analysis a while ago. Now we are back with the rest, including performance metrics specifically for these types of models. I'd like to show how you can now leverage the entire framework for survival analysis: for all steps of the modeling process, from data prep to tuning. We are so excited to show you all of this! 

Evaluating time-to-event models is hard - Max KuhnCensoring in data can frequently occur when we have a time-to-event. For example, if we order a pizza that has not yet arrived after 5 minutes, it is censored; we don't know the final delivery time, but we know it is at least 5 minutes. Censored values can appear in clinical trials, customer churn analysis, pet adoption statistics, or anywhere a duration of time is used. I'll describe different ways to assess models for censored data and focus on metrics requiring an evaluation time (i.e., how well does the model work at 5 minutes?). I'll also describe how you can use tidymodel's expanded features for these data to tell if your model fits the data well.This talk is designed to be paired with the other tidymodels talk by Hannah Frick.  

Fair machine learning - Simon CouchIn recent years, high-profile analyses have called attention to many contexts where the use of machine learning deepened inequities in our communities. After a year of research and design, the tidymodels team is excited to share a set of tools to help data scientists develop fair machine learning models and communicate about them effectively. This talk will introduce the research field of machine learning fairness and demonstrate a fairness-oriented analysis of a machine learning model with tidymodels. 

Tidypredict with recipes, turn workflow to SQL, spark, duckdb and beyond - Emil HvitfeldtTidypredict is one of my favorite packages. Being able to turn a fitted model object into an equation is very powerful! However in tidymodels, we use recipes more and more to do preprocessing. So far, tidypredict didn’t have support for recipes, which severely limited its uses. This talk is about how I fixed that issue. Spending a couple of years thinking about this problem, I finally found a way! Being able to turn a tidymodels workflow into a series of equations for prediction is super powerful. For some uses, being able to turn a model to predict inside SQL, spark or duckdb allows us to handle some problems with more ease.

Join me as I share my journey of switching from the server-based headaches of Wordpress to Quarto, with a little help from AI. In this talk, I’ll describe the simple trick I used to convert an existing Wordpress blog—complete with custom scripts, styles, and beautiful 3D dataviz content—into a slick Quarto site. I'll then demonstrate some lesser-known features of Quarto to automate deploying a website entirely from a Quarto project file. Finally, I’ll show you how I used AI to customize and style my new Quarto site, and provide several useful strategies to employ if you decide to get some help from AI on your own Quarto journey.
Beyond Dashboards: Dynamic Data Storytelling with Python, R, and Quarto Emails - Sean NguyenIn this talk, I’ll confront the traditional dependence on dashboards for business intelligence, pointing out their shortcomings in delivering prompt insights to business professionals. I will propose a shift in strategy that employs Python and R to generate dynamic, customized emails, utilizing Quarto and Posit Connect for seamless automation. This technique guarantees direct and effective delivery of actionable insights to users' inboxes, enhancing informed decision-making and boosting engagement. This recommendation not only redefines the method of data delivery for optimal impact but also prompts a fundamental change in mindset among data practitioners, urging them towards a more engaged and individualized form of data narration.
Creating Reproducible Static Reports - Orla DoyleIn clinical trials we work in interdisciplinary teams where the discussion of outputs is often facilitated using static documents. We wanted to bring the advantages of modern tools (R, markdown, git) and software development practices to the production of company documents. We used an object-oriented approach to create classes for report items with a suite of tests. Finally, the report is rendered programmatically in docx format using a company template. This enables our statisticians to work in a truly end to end fashion within a GxP environment with the end product in a format suitable for interdisciplinary collaboration. We are currently piloting this package internally before we release in the open-source community. 
Quarto: A Multifaceted Publishing Powerhouse for Medical Researchers - Joshua CookTraditional medical research dissemination is slow and cumbersome, often culminating in a diverse array of outputs: reports for our sponsors and regulators, manuscripts for peer-reviewed journals, summaries for online platforms, and presentations for conferences. However, it takes a great deal of time and effort to organize all these outputs so that our findings can enter the patient setting. Quarto can change that. It's a tool that lets us efficiently create various polished formats from a single source, while meeting diverse submission requirements. This talk will showcase how Quarto can revolutionize our communication, making research more impactful and speeding up the delivery of treatments to our patients.",Columbia A/B

Making an App a System - Andrew BatesWhat data processing in your Shiny app is redundant or must happen within the app at all? What makes Shiny beautiful is how it blends data visualization into a compact bundle of code. That said, there are challenges to overcome to get from a developer’s console to users’ screens. Tools like Posit Connect help with this process, but as an app matures, developers and their users may encounter different performance issues. To address this, sometimes this means evolving and introducing separate data pipelines. In this presentation, we will overview some different types of scaling issues for a Shiny app. Additionally, we will introduce the new package {matte}, which provides support for adding data pipelines to your app that live outside Shiny. 
Empowering Decisions: Advanced Portfolio Analysis and Management through Shiny - Lovekumar PatelThis talk explores the creation of an advanced portfolio analysis system using Shiny and Plumber API. Focused on delivering real-time insights and interactive tools, the system transforms financial analysis with user-centric design and reusable Shiny modules.

Data Contracts: Keep Your Weekend Work-Free! - Nick Pelikan 
This talk will discuss data contracts – agreements between data producers and data consumers that ensure data is always available in the expected form. We'll delve into processes and techniques I've developed that can help teams easily create data contracts. This talk will also introduce a literate programming framework that can enable data producers and data consumers who work on different teams, in completely different programming languages (or no programming language at all!) to collaborate on creating data contracts, and allow them to be enforced automatically. 
Demystifying Data Modeling - Kshitij Aranke 
Data Modeling – what is it, why is it useful, and how dbt makes it easy. 
As a previous R user, I was very skeptical of the value of data modeling when I first came across it. But over time, I realized that it helped organizations scale up analytics practices by standardizing on consistent definitions for metrics, improving debuggability for data pipelines, and even enabling rapid experimentation. I want to share this magic with the posit::conf community, and especially how dbt is a tool that's oriented around this practice. 
{mirai} and {crew}: next-generation async to supercharge {promises}, Plumber, Shiny, and {targets} - Charlie Gao and Will Landau 
{mirai} is a minimalist, futuristic and reliable way to parallelise computations – either on the local machine, or across the network. It combines the latest scheduling technologies with fast, secure connection types. With built-in integration to {promises}, {mirai} provides a simple and efficient asynchronous back-end for Shiny and Plumber apps. The {crew} package extends {mirai} to batch computing environments for massively parallel statistical pipelines, e.g. Bayesian modeling, simulations, and machine learning. It consolidates tasks in a central {R6} controller, auto-scales workers, and helps users create plug-ins for platforms like SLURM and AWS Batch. It is the new workhorse powering high performance computing in {targets}. 
Deploying data applications and documents to the cloud - Alex Chisholm 
Creating engaging data content has never been easier, yet easily sharing remains a challenge. And that's the point, right? You cleaned the data, wrangled it, and summarized everything for others to benefit. But where do you put that final result? If you're still using R Markdown, perhaps it's rpubs.com. If you've adopted Quarto, it could be quartopub.com. Have a Jupyter notebook? Well, that's a different service. And this is just for docs. Want to deploy a streamlit app? Head to streamlit.io. Shiny? Log into shinyapps.io. Dash? You could use ploomber.io, if you have a docker file - and know what that is.

Making Waves with R, Python, and Quarto - Regina Lionheart 
Wave models are powerful tools for understanding coastal erosion, but analyzing their outputs pose challenges. Proprietary formats produce inaccessible data that require manual extraction. Final results must also be approachable to a diverse audience of engineers, governments, and coastal communities. In 2022, a project was proposed to investigate how a restored beach could respond to waves while mitigating erosion and protecting a cultural resource. Using R and Python wrapped in Quarto, wave model outputs were fully scripted to create a single reproducible document flexible enough to answer multiple modeling questions. As coasts change, rapid modeling and analysis may help preserve coastal access for years to come. 
Why You Should Think Like an End-to-end Data Scientist, and How - Adam Wang 
Machine learning (ML) solutions are becoming ubiquitous when tackling challenging problems, enabling end-users to access reliable, insightful information. However, many components of these solutions rely on domains outside traditional data science — e.g., data, DevOps, and software engineering. 
In this talk, I'll walk through an end-to-end ML solution we built for transplant centers to identify likely stem cell donors. We'll then focus on how interacting with domains outside traditional data science can immensely help a project succeed and increase your impact. 
You will take away specific examples on why thinking end-to-end can enhance your ML solutions, and how to start applying these principles at your own organization.

Report Design in R: Small Tweaks that Make a Big Difference - David Keyes If you've ever tried to improve how your Quarto-based reports look, you probably felt overwhelmed. I'm a data person, you may have thought, not a designer. It's easy to drown in a sea of design advice, but we at R for the Rest of Us have found that a few small tweaks can make a big difference. In this talk, we will discuss ways that we have learned to make high-quality reports in R. These include ways you can consistently use brand fonts and colors in your report text and in your plots. All of these tweaks are small on their own, but, when combined, have the potential to make a big difference in the quality of your report design. 
Reproducible, dynamic, and elegant books with Quarto - Mine Cetinkaya-RundelBuilding on my experience writing books with Quarto for various audiences (R learners, statistics learners, and Quarto learners), for various venues (self-published and publisher-published), in various formats (HTML books hosted online and PDF books printed), I will share best practices and tips and tricks for authoring reproducible, dynamic, and elegant books with Quarto. I will also highlight a few features from the recently-released Quarto 1.4 that pertain to books (e.g., flexible and custom cross-references, embedding computations from notebooks, and inline code in multiple languages) as well as share examples of how to make your web-hosted books more interactive with tools like webR and shinylive. 
Designing and Deploying Internal Quarto Templates - Meghan HallQuarto is a game-changer for creating reproducible, parameterized documents. But the beauty of Quarto—that it has so many different use cases with various output formats—can lead to disarray with numerous .qmd files floating around an organization and too much copy-paste when creating something new. Quarto templates are perfect for easing the burden of developing a report and instead standardizing the structure, style, and initial content of your projects, no matter the output format. We’ll discuss tips and tricks for implementing enough html and css to create beautiful documents that match your organization’s branding and also explore how easy it can be to deploy those Quarto templates with a single function within an internal R package. 
Closeread: bringing Scrollytelling to Quarto - Andrew BrayScrollytelling is a style of web design that transitions graphics and text as a user scrolls, allowing stories to progress naturally.

Data Wrangling for Advocacy: Tidy Data to Support the Affordable Connectivity Program - Christine Parker 
We sought to create a dashboard to highlight some frequently asked statistics about the Affordable Connectivity Program. To accomplish this goal, I transformed the program data which consist of enrollment and claims summarized over different geographies and updated at different times (tidyverse); collected demographic data from the Census Bureau (tidycensus); modeled future enrollment and expenditure scenarios (lme4, plotly); and created geospatial datasets to illustrate our findings in maps (tigris, arcgisbinding). The messy datasets posed a steep learning curve. We were among the few organizations that worked with these data to translate them into meaningful insights and I'd like to share how we were able to create such a useful resource. 
Leveraging Data in a Volunteer Fire Department - Joseph Richey 
The majority of fire departments in the United States are volunteer based organizations. As an emerging professional in the field of data science, I was able to help my local fire department track, manage, and analyze data using R shiny, Python, and AWS. This has allowed for increased efficiency within the department, and better transparency for fire department and local government officials. 
Novice to data scientist: how a pediatric anesthesiologist used R Studio to help disadvantaged kids access surgical care - Nick Pratap 
When a surgical procedure gets cancelled, a child gains no health benefit, families' time off work and pre-op anxiety is in vain, and our not-for-profit children's hospital loses ~$1 per second. To understand cancellation, I needed to analyze thousands of patient records. Despite zero formal training, I learned to tidy then visualize data – and even do geocoding and machine learning. Once we identified children at high risk, we could target additional support to their families. Furthermore, we showed that surgery cancellation contributes to health inequality. The R Studio/tidyverse ecosystem allows novices to do sophisticated analytics, and is helping us improve access to health care for the most disadvantaged children in our communities. 
A Machine Learning Approach to Protect Patients from Blood Tube Mix-Ups - Brendan Graham 
A wrong blood in tube (WBIT) error occurs when blood collected from one patient is labeled as though it was collected from a different patient. While rare, these errors can cause serious, potentially life threatening patient safety events. This talk is about how a team of pathology informaticists and data scientists developed and deployed a multi-analyte WBIT detection model at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

Posit Academy in the Age of Generative AI - Lessons from the Frontlines - James WadeThe rise of generative AI is fundamentally changing how we learn to code. At Dow, we've had nearly 200 learners participate in Posit Academy to learn R or python and apply it to their work. As coders embrace these new tools, we are witnessing a ""before and after"" moment. This talk will share real-world examples of how researchers at Dow are learning by using code generation, highlighting the most effective tools including copilots and chat agents, to grapple with the challenges and opportunities of learning to code in this transformative era. 
Deep Learning is Just LEGO: and Other Hands on Machine Learning Activities - Chelsea Parlett-PelleritiMachine Learning involves a lot of math, and a lot of code. But it can also involve LEGO, coloring sheets, and 3D printed gradients! Hands on, kinesthetic activities help people learn complex technical concepts in an intuitive way, and to be honest, provide a welcome break from all the formulas and function definitions. These activities not only increase engagement, but make the topic more accessible to a wider range of people. Come learn how to use and design these activities for yourself, or for a class! 
Supporting Social Good Through Community-Based Data Science Education - Carrie WrightIn this data-centric era, the demand for responsible data science practitioners is more crucial than ever. However many data science education programs don’t adequately emphasize data ethics. To address this need, my colleagues, Ava Hoffman, Michael Rosenblum, and I have developed a course at Johns Hopkins, offering students hands-on experiences collaborating with community-based organizations on diverse data science projects. We've partnered with organizations championing various causes, including youth leadership, voting rights, transportation advocacy, and community tool banks. We've gained valuable insights about hands-on data ethics education and demonstrated that even data science education itself can support social good. 
AI for Gaming: How I Built a Bot to Play a Video-Game with R and Python - Aleksander DietrichsonI recently undertook to build a robot to play a video game online. Using reinforcement learning, a custom computer vision model, and browser automation –all implemented in R/Python– I was able to create an AI which played the game to perfection. In this presentation I will share the lessons learned as I went through this process, and some hints to avoid the pitfalls I tackled. I will present some real-world business cases to answer the obvious why-question. For colleagues who teach Data Science and AI, I will show how an activity such as this can provide the entry-point and basis for discussion for more than half a dozen topics, ranging from formal logic, game theory, empirical inference, all the way to Shiny and Quarto.",300 | Columbia C

Elevating enterprise data through open source LLMs - Zac Davies 
In an era where data privacy and security are paramount, many organizations are keen on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with their proprietary data without exposing it to third-party services. Recognizing this need, our talk, ""Elevating Enterprise Data Through Open Source LLMs,"" showcases an approach that integrates the capabilities of Databricks and Posit, enabling businesses to maintain ownership and control over their data and LLMs while delivering value to their customers. The core of our discussion revolves around a system architecture that synergizes the strengths of Databricks and Posit technologies, providing a comprehensive solution for enterprise data and open source LLMs. Databricks is responsible for data management and processing, offering a seamless environment for hosting, serving, and fine-tuning open source LLMs. Keeping data and models in the secure perimeter of Databricks lowers the risk of data exfiltration tremendously, and also benefits from the scalable data processing and machine learning capabilities - including recent acquisition MosaicML - that Databricks delivers. Posit steps in to streamline the process through Posit Workbench, the developer platform for data science with custom integrations for working with Databricks. This allows developers to write, test, and refine their code in a familiar and powerful setting while still being able to access the data, compute and model serving offered by Databricks. In addition, Posit Connect offers an easy to use platform for deploying these applications, ensuring that the end-to-end process, from development to deployment, is efficient, secure, and aligned with enterprise standards. 
Attendees of this talk will gain valuable insights into constructing and deploying LLM-powered applications using their enterprise data. By the end of the session, you will have a clear understanding of how to leverage Databricks for optimal data management and LLM operations, alongside Posit's streamlined development and deployment processes. This knowledge will empower you to deliver secure, effective, and scalable LLM-powered applications, driving innovation and value from your enterprise data while upholding the highest standards of data privacy and security.

Using Generative AI to Increase the Impact of Your Data Science Work - Alok Pattani 
Over the past year plus, generative AI has taken the world by storm. While use cases for helping people with writing, code generation, and creative endeavors are abundant, less attention has been paid to how generative AI tools can be used to do new things within data science workflows. This talk will cover how Google's generative AI models, including Gemini, can be used to help data practitioners work with non-traditional data (text, images, videos) and create multimodal outputs from analysis, increasing the scale, velocity, and impact of data science results. Attendees should expect to come away with ideas of how to apply Google generative AI tools to real-world data science problems in both Python and R.",Elwha
Keynote Session: Data Wrangling [for Python or R] Like a Boss With DuckDB | Hannes Mühleisen,08/14/2024,16:15:00,08/14/2024,17:15:00,False,"Speakers:

Abstracts:
Data wrangling is the thorny hedge that higher powers have placed in front of the enjoyable task of actually analyzing or visualizing data. Common struggles come from importing data from ill-mannered CSV files, the tedious task of orchestrating efficient data transformation, or the inevitable management of changes to tables. Data wrangling is rife with questionable ad-hoc solutions, which can sometimes even make things worse.

The design rationale of DuckDB is to support the task of data wrangling by bringing the best of decades of data management research and best practices to the world of interactive data analysis in R or Python. For example, DuckDB has one of the world's most advanced CSV reader, native support for Parquet files and Arrow structures, an efficient parallel vectorized query processing engine, and support for efficient atomic updates to tables. All of this is wrapped up in a zero-dependency package available in a programming language near you for free.

In my talk, I will discuss the above as well as the design rationale of DuckDB, which was designed and built in collaboration with the Data Science community in the first place.",Regency Ballroom
