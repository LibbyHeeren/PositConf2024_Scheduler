HEYYYY! This is the code I used to create the .csv file, which was used to create the [.ics file which you can download and add to your own Google Calendar here](https://datahumans.notion.site/Posit-Conf-2024-Google-Calendar-0af73e68ee94448bb901a937e3e54acc?pvs=4).

Here's what my resulting calendar looks like once I've color coded the events. So satisfying!

It's a partly manual process of harvesting json objects from the conference schedule page, sifting through that messy json, and then building out a csv file. Once I had the csv of events imported into Google Calendar, I realized that I'd left all the events in Pacific time, and the csv format doesn't include time zones, so I modified the time zones manually and then exported a .ics file for folks to use. It will have the events in the correct time zone no matter where you are. Theoretically.

If you're super curious, feel free to check out the code, and here's a [quick explainer video from 2023 (previous year) in lieu of an actual ReadMe for the moment.](https://youtu.be/XzHaBQR4DB0)
